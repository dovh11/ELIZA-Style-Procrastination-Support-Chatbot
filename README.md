# ELIZA-Style Procrastination Support Chatbot

## 📌 Overview

This project is a rule-based conversational agent implemented in Python, inspired by the classic ELIZA architecture (created by Joseph Weizenbaum). Tailored specifically to address productivity issues, this chatbot acts as a digital companion to help users manage procrastination, overcome creative blocks, and regain focus.

The core logic and dialogue state management methodologies are heavily inspired by the concepts taught in Jurafsky & Martin's renowned textbook, *Speech and Language Processing*.

## ✨ Features

* **Regex-Based Pattern Matching:** Utilizes Regular Expressions (Regex) to analyze user input, identify key phrases related to procrastination, and determine the structural intent of the sentence.

* **Keyword Transformation:** Implements dynamic perspective-shifting (e.g., transforming "I am" to "you are", "my" to "your") to simulate active listening and empathetic, context-aware responses.

* **Dialogue State Management:** Maintains conversation flow without relying on modern deep learning or LLMs, showcasing a strong understanding of foundational NLP, rule-based systems, and string manipulation.

* **Task-Oriented Responses:** Specifically designed rules to encourage users to break down tasks, reflect on their delaying habits, and take actionable steps.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Libraries:** `re` (Regular Expressions), `random`
* **Domain:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Rule-based AI
